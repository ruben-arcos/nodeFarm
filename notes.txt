// Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

Synchronous === blocking 👎🏼
    Synchronous programming ensures that each statement is executed in a sequential order, and the program waits for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.

Example:

    const fs = require('fs');

    // Blocking code execution
    const input = fs.readFileSync('input.txt', 'utf-8');
    console.log(input)

Asynchronous === non-blocking 👍🏼
    Asynchronous programming allows certain operations to run independently in the background, enabling the program to continue executing other tasks without waiting for these asynchronous operations to complete. Asynchronous functions are often used for non-blocking tasks like handling I/O operations, timers, or events.

            *** I/O, which stands for Input/Output, refers to the interaction between a computer program and the outside world. I/O operations involve     reading from or writing to external sources, such as files, databases, network connections, or user input devices. 

Example:

    const fs = require('fs');

    // Non-blocking code execution
    const input = fs.readFile('input.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
        console.log(data);
    });
    console.log('Reading file...');


Node.js is single thread, for each app there is only one thread

Potential problem: CALLBACK HELL

Example: 

        const fs = require('fs');

        fs.readFile('start.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data1) => {
            fs.readFile(`${data1}.txt`, 'utf-8', (err, data2) => {
                fs.readFile('append.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data3) => {
                    fs.writeFile('final.txt', `${data2} ${data3}`, 'utf-8', (err) => {
                        if (err) throw err;
                        console.log('Your file has been saved :D');
                    })
                })
            })
        })

SOLUTION: Using promises or Async/Await

// Server

Local host has this address as default -----> 127.0.0.1


// Routing

Routing means implementing different actions for different URLs


*** use command D to select words and edit them at the same time

What is an HTTP header? A piece of information about the response that we are sending back 

// API

What is an API? A service from which we can request some data

JSON is a very simple text format that looks a lot like JavaScript. We have one big array which contains objects, then each object has the ID, product name, image, and so forth

when we send JSON, we need to say application/json, and for HTML, it's text/html,

*** In Node.js every file is treated as a module


/// NPM

whenever we start a new project,

is to start with npm init.

So we use npm as the command and then init.

And this will basically create a package.jason file.

Which is kind of a configuration file of our project

where all kinds of data about the project is stored.
